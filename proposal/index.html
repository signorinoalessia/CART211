      <p>Since the early days of IM chats and MUDs, real-time multi user text-based virtual worlds, humans were presented with the promise of anonymity as well as the possibility of separating their physical body from their virtual identity. Identity is intrinsically connected to the concept of a society, whether such society is made of data or flesh and bones. Utopian and dystopian theorists approach this reality as exciting and promising or in a more negative light, decrying the darkest corners of humanity’s psyche. Additionally, the genre of science-fiction has been a vessel of discussing theoretical visions of the future and what the implications of new forms of technology have on society, very often in a drastic manner in order to convey an alarmist message. As its theoretical framework, the following essay will explore the construct of identity in cyber communities, the depiction of race and gender in avatars and the concept of identity  in the animated work of Serial Experiment Lain, which offers unique insights due to its medium and sociocultural context.
      </p> <br>
      <p>The notion of identity has been a fixture and a tool to analyze society’s discourse of what constitutes a component of the self, and what these components signify in relation to the society in which an individual lives in. From a sociological point of view, identity presents a tangible window into the traits that are valued and held as a way of differentiating, as well as connecting one’s persona to the collective culture. As Nakamura highlights in her article, ““identity” is a term that persists in critical discourse despite anti-essentialist challenges to its usefulness because it permits analysis of the ways that discourse creates subjects. Identity is a concept that proves particularly useful in the case of signifying forms that, like new media and IM in particular, engage in the active rearticulation of self and discourse.” (Nakamura, 47) Identity proves to be particularly insightful when speculating what establishes identity in the context of new media platforms such as virtual 3D interfaces, IM chats and multi-players games. The relative anonymity was a pillar of the premise of interacting in a virtual world. However, that proves to be too idealistic, as we are increasingly living in a more globalized cultural world. The references of cultural material are progressively more bridged, and current social media platforms demand more transparency when registering. As Carrasco mentions in her essay, the physical body remains an anchor to the experience a user might have on a digital base. Disembodiment becomes a method of rejecting one’s features and reinventing said body.  “The importance of embodiment in digital contexts, abandoning the idea of the human body as a fixed identity (...) virtual reality encounters provide an illusion of control over reality, nature, and especially over a gendered and race-marked body.” (Carrasco, 37) The constructed self on a digital platform allows the real to merge with the imaginary, without the dissolution of identity markers such as gender, race and age. This feature proves to be disturbing to some theorists, as it undermines our conventional ways of “reading” other fellow members of a society. Since the dawn of days, the relationship of society and technology has been continually been going through a familiar pendulum of initial fear, rejection, speculation and final acceptance into one’s personal habits. In order to recreate a sense of familiarity in one’s interactions, visual supports help extend conventional markers in the fabricated digital world.
      </p> <br>
      <p>Avatars become the vessel for depicting age, race, and gender in cyber communities, as well as ways of showing other cyber-citizens one’s preferences, taste and political stances, in the similar vein of how one would show so through their garments and accessories. Most importantly, these visual personas, are not only an extension of the physical culture, but they contribute to the creation of meaning in society. As Nakamura points out, “these avatars work as supplementary imaging practices: they are part of a visual culture in which identity is added to, rather than replaced by, images of race, gender, and nation” (Nakamura, 49) The ability to fabricate a new identity does not have to be constrained to be a facsimile of the physical person standing being their interface. Roleplaying in forums, for example, allows the user to explore different facets of their own persona, or perhaps to reinvent oneself completely. The approach that one takes to portray themselves can reject their own society,  mirror it, or distort it as they wish within the constraints of the community in which it operates. As Tyminski proposes, the Internet becomes a fantasized container in which one tests their own ego in relation to others. “Lacking this protective boundary, other ego capacities can suffer, such as reality testing, flexible thinking about choices, and affective modulation. Reinforcement of magical thinking might further inflate an omnipotent attitude about the self. This omnipotence undercuts one’s ability to relate in cooperation, mutuality, and acceptance of limitations.“ (Tyminski, 236). The definition of the self is rooted in core values, but temperamental features is flexible and adapts to social circumstances. In a sense, the self is reflected back from society, and this dynamic assists the formation of the self. One must therefore take in consideration the undergoing discourse of said society in order to determine what it will respond back.
