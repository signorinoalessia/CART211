		<h2>As We May Think</h2>
		<p class="reading">
			In the essay published by Vannevar Bush in 1945, there are many chilling points raised that would lead the reader to believe that he traveled in time to catch a glimpse of the future. He recalls scientists about how they joined forces under the obligation of war conditions for physicists, biologists and scientists towards the common cause of weaponry and destructive technology. Once war was over, he suggests to treasure the same environment of sharing information, due to the necessity of bridging disciplines for innovation. Nonetheless, there was the challenge of the increasing quantity of research accumulating and not being stored efficiently, thus causing the intended researchers of the field to be unable to unearth information. There is an interesting duality of such a challenge fabricated by scientific persons: information was becoming more specialized and in a growing quantity. The ways of information publication has been extended beyond the current means, especially since at the time, archiving systems were still primarily analogue. Vannevar recognizes the arrival
			of mechanical aids, but that inventions depend greatly on the economic landscapes they are set in. For example, two centuries prior, Leibnitz’s invention was not developed because in its current context, the labour and cost outweighed the positive results of the labour saved. Without the proper finances, it is difficult to justify inverting energy and labour into them. In the 40s, technology was becoming gradually a lot more affordable, thus allowing for expansion of existing prototypes.
			The existing concept of recording information relied on different physical mediums, such as wax, film and magnetics wires.  Camera technology was becoming smaller and could accommodate finer grained-sensitive compounds. Despite further developments, photography always required wetting the plate or the film during development. Vannevar wishes how technology could requires less steps to get to tangible results. “Often it would be advantageous to be able to snap the camera and to look at the picture immediately”. This quote is so wonderful because it points out an aspect that is now so ubiquitous that it is taken for granted. The author also explores the potential of television equipment that uses a beam of electrons instead of a moving pointer, and a screen which glows when the electrons hit it instead of chemically modifying matter. Vannevar ponders upon the possible development of this technology and foresaw the concept of hard drives, the idea of storing great amounts of information into a disproportionate smaller receptacle. He expands on auditory reproductions, such as the first voice synthetiser. Voder was proof of a machine talking back without the vocal input of a human. The Vocoder would pick up sound.The Vocoder was similar to the stenotype, in the manner which it was only understood but those that were trained into using it. The mechanization of languages was clunky especially in the scientific field. Vannevar dreamt also of remote storage of data, where an investigator needs not to be in a static place to record, type, photograph. He compares the punched-card machines that record info positionally in which operations are delegated to other machines. But most importantly, he raises the thought about the interface of access being as vital as the dissemination of information. Vannevar’s musings touch incredibly close to the various technologies that one uses everyday. His essay suggests the birth of computers and the Internet, almost as if he was foreseeing that humanity was at the edge of a revolution of information systems.

		<h2>Writing the history of the Internet of Roy Rosenzweig</h2>
		<p class="reading">
				In the article Writing the history of the Internet,  Roy Rosenzweig asks the reader to think of any reference of the Internet in Post-World War II American history textbooks, implying that there is not much written on the matter. The author proceeds to speculate on how history will be written and to keep the biographic, bureaucratic, ideological and social aspects in mind. The internet was far from being a novel invention, even in the 90s when this article was written. It was difficult to depict where the future of the Internet was headed, but Roy was certain that it would be a strong presence in different spheres of our society and that technology would de-centralize from the environment of scientists and bureaucrats that had helped build it. Roy saw the potential of the Internet to support commercial and leisure activities such as watching a movie, shopping and socializing. The context in which the Arpanet was born is a crucial factor to the open and accessible philosophy that is quintessential to the Internet. The 60s in America were times in which the youth was undergoing a countercultural revolution which grouped university students rejecting proprietary computer systems as well as more conventional hippies. The author writes that the vision of an open Internet came from hackers, such as Bill Gates and Paul Allen during their teenager years spreading programs for free over the Internet. I feel a bit skeptical about giving merit to a wave of values to a handful of individuals. Rather, I believe American society’s cultural changes along with the beginning of commercialisation of a new technology must have created an environment where anything seemed possible. Thinkers were creating manifestos such as Computer Lib and called people to arms against bureaucracies. Prior to the 1980s, the Internet was a relatively open area in which anyone with a computer and access to Internet could have a voice in. But by 1980s, many services, hardware and softwares were getting privatized and agglomerated by growing tech giants. In order to decentralize the Internet, it was necessary to demonopolize the control that Microsoft and Intel had on personal computers. At some point, Bill Gates’ company was close to own all the browsers from which to access Internet, which went against the very core value of what the Internet is. The Internet has been shaped not only by its creators, but its users, the Netizens, but from hackers, advocates of a free space as well.
